# sylphrena
Pseudonymous, trustless transfers of Ether tokens with low-traceability by using `create2` &amp; `selfdestruct`

Named after the spren of the Stormlight Archive series. Functions intentionally (but poorly) lore-driven to encourage stronger understanding of smart contract behavior.

# Use Case: Anonymous Transfers

Alice wants to send Charlie some ether tokens but wants to conceal the transfer such that Charlie cannot trace the funds back to Aliceâ€™s EOA.

# Solidity

1. Alice sends Ether to a designated EOA address, referred to as the *escrow address* (the address eventually gets bytecode via CREATE2)
2. Alice (using a different wallet) registers Charlie as a recipient, and adds the address amongst a pool of other recipients
3. Bob calls a function which deploys a self-destructible contract to one of the escrow EOAs. The escrow contract is atomically SELFDESTRUCT'd and funds are sent to Charlie's address


```solidity
// obtain an address, that initially appears as an EOA
(address escrow, uint256 salt) = getAddress()

// alice sends money to the escrow EOA
(bool sent,) = address(escrow).call{value: 0.01 ether}("");

// alice registers Charlie as a recipient
// (alice preferably uses a different EOA)
addRecipient(address(charlie), salt)

// Bob, an external party, calls this function to route the transfer to charlie
function route(uint256 salt) external {
    // deploys bytecode to the escrow EOA, converting it
    // to a contract with self destruct functionality
    address escrow = create2(..., salt);

    // contract pseudo-randomly picks charlie as a recipient
    // the pseudo-random selection is used to mask intention
    address charlie = popRandomRecipient();

    // selfdestruct the newly created contract, and direct the funds to charlie
    Escrow(escrow).destroy(charlie);
}
```

There's some traceability in this single-party example, but with many inbound/outbound addresses you can achieve pseudonymity through obfuscation. The EOAs holding the funds (which get self-destructed) can be shuffled so Alice's funds never have a direct trace to Charlie's address.
